# Revision 2 (2025/11/01): Refactored based on feedback from Qiita
Based on valuable feedback from the Qiita community, this project has been refactored. 

・Replaced for loops with list comprehensions to improve readability. 

・Refactored the comp() function to use a more efficient logic with zip() and sum().

・Corrected a logic bug in the Hit/Blow calculation.
